# Options Strategy Risk & Reward Analyzer

This project provides a web-based tool for analyzing the risk and reward associated with various options trading strategies. It allows users to input up to four different options contracts and visualize the potential profit/loss at different prices of the underlying asset at expiry. Additionally, it calculates the maximum profit, maximum loss, and break-even points for the given set of contracts.

- **Risk & Reward Graph**: Visualizes the profit or loss across a range of underlying asset prices at expiry.
- **Calculation of Financial Metrics**: Automatically calculates the maximum potential profit, maximum potential loss, and break-even points based on the provided contracts.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can add or remove contracts dynamically and see the graph and metrics update in real-time.
